								    <h2>5. Information About Cookies & Similar Technologies</h2>
								    <p>5.1 What are cookies and similar technologies?</p>
								    <p>A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device when you visit a website. The cookie will help website providers to recognise your device the next time you visit their website. There are other similar technologies such as pixel tags, web bugs, web storage, and other similar files and technologies that can also do the same thing as cookies. We use the term "cookies" in this policy to refer to cookies and all such similar technologies that collect information in this way.</p>
								    <p>5.2 How we use cookies.</p>
								    <p>We use cookies for the purposes:</p>
								    <ul>
								        <li>Performance/analytics - we use these cookies to analyse how our Services are accessed, used or are performing. We use this information to maintain, operate and continually improve the Services. We may also obtain information from our e-mail newsletters, to learn whether you opened or forwarded the newsletter or clicked on any of the content. This information tells us about our newsletters' effectiveness and helps us ensure that we're delivering information that you find interesting.</li>
								    </ul>
								    <p>5.3 Manage your preferences.</p>
								    <p>Most web browsers allow you to manage your cookie preferences. You can set your browser to refuse cookies or delete certain cookies. Generally, you should also be able to manage similar technologies in the same way that you manage cookies using your browser's preferences. The following links show how to adjust the browser settings of commonly used browsers:</p>

								        <li><a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Enabling+and+disabling+cookies" target="_blank">Firefox</a></li>
								        <li><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/index?page=search&fac=all&q=cookies%20safari" target="_blank">Safari</a></li>
								        <li><a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95647" target="_blank">Chrome</a></li>
								    </ul>

								    <h2>6. Security</h2>
								    <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. If you have any questions you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@jmobbi.com">support@jmobbi.com</a>.</p>

								    <h2>7. Correcting and Updating Your Personal Information</h2>
								    <p>To review and update your personal information to ensure it is accurate, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@jmobbi.com">support@jmobbi.com</a>.</p>

								    <h2>8. Notification of Privacy Statement Changes</h2>
								    <p>We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices.

We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>

								    <h2>9. Google User Data</h2>
								    <p>Some of our applications have the ability to connect to your Google Drive account, allowing you to manage files and play media content located in your Google Drive account. Once you connect your Google Drive account to the application, it uses an OAuth access token and the <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/about-sdk">official Google Drive SDK</a> to handle requests to the Google Drive server. We do not store any of your personal information when you connect your Google Drive account. All your personal information and connection data, including the access token, are securely stored locally on your device in the Keychain, a secure system storage. You have control over your access. If you ever wish to revoke access to your Google Drive account, you can do so at any time by opening the account settings page in your web browser. Additionally, within the application settings, you can disconnect your Google Drive account, and all connection data, including the access token, will be removed from your device. You can conveniently download your personal files from the connected Google Drive account to your device, and these files will be placed in the App Documents directory. You can remove these files at any time using the built-in file manager in the application. Application does not share any information from your Google account. Our use and handling of data obtained from Google APIs adhere to <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>

								    <h2>10. Google Mobile Ads</h2>
									<p>Some of our applications use Google Mobile Ads SDK for monetization. To improve the performance of AdMob, the Google Mobile Ads SDK may collect certain information from apps, including:
									                            IP address, which may be used to estimate the general location of a device.
									                            Non-user related crash logs, which may be used to diagnose problems and improve the SDK. Diagnostic information may also be used for advertising and analytics purposes.
									                            User-associated performance data such as app launch time, hang rate, or energy usage, which may be used to evaluate user behavior, understand the effectiveness of existing product features, and plan new features. Performance data may also be used for displaying ads, including sharing with other entities that display ads.
									                            A Device ID such as the device's advertising identifier or other app-bounded device identifiers, which may be used for the purpose of third-party advertising and analytics.
									                            Advertising data, such as advertisements the user has seen, may be used to power analytics and advertising features.
									                            Other user product interactions like app launch taps, and interaction information, like video views, may be used to improve advertising performance.</p>
